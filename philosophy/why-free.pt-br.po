"Not everyone wants it to be easier.  The system of copyright gives software "
"programs &ldquo;owners&rdquo;, most of whom aim to withhold software's "
"potential benefit from the rest of the public.  They would like to be the "
"only ones who can copy and modify the software that we use."

"The copyright system grew up with printing&mdash;a technology for "
"mass-production copying.  Copyright fit in well with this technology because "
"it restricted only the mass producers of copies.  It did not take freedom "
"away from readers of books.  An ordinary reader, who did not own a printing "
"press, could copy books only with pen and ink, and few readers were sued for "
"that."

"Digital technology is more flexible than the printing press: when "
"information has digital form, you can easily copy it to share it with "
"others.  This very flexibility makes a bad fit with a system like "
"copyright.  That's the reason for the increasingly nasty and draconian "
"measures now used to enforce software copyright.  Consider these four "
"practices of the Software Publishers Association (SPA):"

"All four practices resemble those used in the former Soviet Union, where "
"every copying machine had a guard to prevent forbidden copying, and where "
"individuals had to copy information secretly and pass it from hand to hand "
"as samizdat.  There is of course a difference: the motive for information "
"control in the Soviet Union was political; in the US the motive is profit.  "
"But it is the actions that affect us, not the motive.  Any attempt to block "
"the sharing of information, no matter why, leads to the same methods and the "

"Owners use smear words such as &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;theft&rdquo;, "
"as well as expert terminology such as &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; "

"public&mdash;a simplistic analogy between programs and physical objects."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"Our ideas and intuitions about property for material objects are about "

"Owners say that they suffer &ldquo;harm&rdquo; or &ldquo;economic "
"loss&rdquo; when users copy programs themselves.  But the copying has no "
"direct effect on the owner, and it harms no one.  The owner can lose only if "
"the person who made the copy would otherwise have paid for one from the "
"owner."
msgstr ""

"A little thought shows that most such people would not have bought copies.  "

"Owners often describe the current state of the law, and the harsh penalties "

"It's elementary that laws don't decide right and wrong.  Every American "

"Authors often claim a special connection with programs they have written, "
"and go on to assert that, as a result, their desires and interests "
"concerning the program simply outweigh those of anyone else&mdash;or even "
"those of the whole rest of the world.  (Typically companies, not authors, "
"hold the copyrights on software, but we are expected to ignore this "

"But people in general are only likely to feel any sympathy with the natural "

msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"One reason is an overstretched analogy with material objects.  When I cook "
"spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats it, because then I cannot eat "
"it.  His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of us "
"can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which one? The smallest "
"distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical balance."
msgstr ""

"But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects you directly and me "
"only indirectly.  Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and "

"tell you not to do these things.  No one should."
msgstr ""

"The second reason is that people have been told that natural rights for "
"authors is the accepted and unquestioned tradition of our society."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"As a matter of history, the opposite is true.  The idea of natural rights of "
"authors was proposed and decisively rejected when the US Constitution was "
"drawn up.  That's why the Constitution only <em>permits</em> a system of "
"copyright and does not <em>require</em> one; that's why it says that "
"copyright must be temporary.  It also states that the purpose of copyright "
"is to promote progress&mdash;not to reward authors.  Copyright does reward "
"authors somewhat, and publishers more, but that is intended as a means of "
"modifying their behavior."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>

"The real established tradition of our society is that copyright cuts into "
"the natural rights of the public&mdash;and that this can only be justified "

"The final argument made for having owners of software is that this leads to "
"production of more software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"Unlike the others, this argument at least takes a legitimate approach to the "
"subject.  It is based on a valid goal&mdash;satisfying the users of "
"software.  And it is empirically clear that people will produce more of "
"something if they are well paid for doing so."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"But the economic argument has a flaw: it is based on the assumption that the "
"difference is only a matter of how much money we have to pay.  It assumes "
"that <em>production of software</em> is what we want, whether the software "
"has owners or not."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"People readily accept this assumption because it accords with our "
"experiences with material objects.  Consider a sandwich, for instance.  You "
"might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either gratis or for a "
"price.  If so, the amount you pay is the only difference.  Whether or not "
"you have to buy it, the sandwich has the same taste, the same nutritional "
"value, and in either case you can only eat it once.  Whether you get the "
"sandwich from an owner or not cannot directly affect anything but the amount "
"of money you have afterwards."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"This is true for any kind of material object&mdash;whether or not it has an "
"owner does not directly affect what it <em>is</em>, or what you can do with "
"it if you acquire it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <ul><li><p>
msgid ""
"But if a program has an owner, this very much affects what it is, and what "
"you can do with a copy if you buy one.  The difference is not just a matter "
"of money.  The system of owners of software encourages software owners to "
"produce something&mdash;but not what society really needs.  And it causes "
"intangible ethical pollution that affects us all."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"What does society need? It needs information that is truly available to its "
"citizens&mdash;for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and "
"improve, not just operate.  But what software owners typically deliver is a "
"black box that we can't study or change."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"Society also needs freedom.  When a program has an owner, the users lose "
"freedom to control part of their own lives."
msgstr ""

#. type: Content of: <p>
msgid ""
"And, above all, society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary "
"cooperation in its citizens.  When software owners tell us that helping our "
"neighbors in a natural way is &ldquo;piracy&rdquo;, they pollute our "
"society's civic spirit."

"This is why we say that <a href=\"/philosophy/free-sw.html\">free "

"The economic argument for owners is erroneous, but the economic issue is "
"real.  Some people write useful software for the pleasure of writing it or "
"for admiration and love; but if we want more software than those people "
"write, we need to raise funds."

"Since the 1980s, free software developers have tried various methods of "
"finding funds, with some success.  There's no need to make anyone rich; a "

"For years, until a fellowship made it unnecessary, I made a living from "
"custom enhancements of the free software I had written.  Each enhancement "
"was added to the standard released version and thus eventually became "

"the enhancements they wanted, rather than on the features I would otherwise "

"In the early 1990s, companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments "
